# talks-and-workshops (WiP)

I like to deliver talks and workshops at communities' meet-ups, conferences, universities or wherever they let me. Why? First, sharing your knowledge is a great way to give back to the tech community, where I have learned so much. Second, it's a fun way of learning myself, not only because it forces you to study the subject very well, but because you have to deliver it, so you have to think about it in many different points of view so that everyone understands you, and that makes you a better communicator. And last, because you get to know great people and great places, and it's fun!

Below, all talks and workshops I have given are gathered, as a way of tracking them and linking to their corresponding materials. Feel free to use any of them and reach out if you have a doubt, suggestion, correction or whatever.
